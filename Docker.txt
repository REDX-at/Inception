Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into isolated containers.

🚀 Key Points About Docker:
✅ Lightweight → Containers share the same OS kernel, making them faster than VMs.
✅ Portable → Runs the same way on any system (Linux, Windows, Mac).
✅ Isolated → Each container has its own environment, preventing conflicts.
✅ Scalable → Easily spin up multiple containers for microservices.

🔥 How Docker Works?
Dockerfile → Defines how to build a container.
Docker Image → A snapshot of the app with all dependencies.
Docker Container → A running instance of an image.
Docker Compose → Manages multiple containers in a project.
🎯 Why Use Docker?
Consistency → No “it works on my machine” issues.
Efficiency → Uses fewer resources than traditional VMs.
Automation → Easily deploy apps with simple commands.
For your Inception project, Docker helps you:
✅ Run NGINX, WordPress, and MariaDB in separate containers.
✅ Keep each service isolated but connected via a Docker network.
✅ Ensure a stable and reproducible infrastructure.
